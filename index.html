	<h1>Finding Happy!</h1>
	<p>Over the last few years, I've read a bunch of resources on happiness. Most of this has been out of curiosity on how people live in other areas, and how I could incorporate some of their ideas into my own life. I created this site to share some basic information I've discovered, and resources.</p>
	<p>One huge decision I've taken away is downsizing everything in life to focus on what truly matters. That means downsizing my home, possessions, and commitments. I cleared out 40% of my clothes in a single weekend, and haven't missed one item.</p>

	<p>I'm a huge fan of TED talks, so I'm going to share a <a href="https://www.ted.com/playlists/4/what_makes_you_happy">link</a> to their curated list of talks on happiness. What I think makes the actual site so good is how easy it is to navigate, and visually pleasing it is as well. </p>
